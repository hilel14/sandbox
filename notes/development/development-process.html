        <ul>
            <li>
                Branching strategy and release management are based on
                <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model">this</a>
                model.
            </li>
            <li>
                Version numbering logic: major.minor.bug-fix
            </li>
            <li>
                Bugzilla version field should match a specific git tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Jar file meta-inf should also match a specific git tag.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Version names logic
        </h2>
        version number = x.y.z where:
        <ul>
            <li>
                X = major change
            </li>
            <li>
                Y = normal change (new features and bug fixes)
            </li>
            <li>
                Z = critical bug fix (hot fix)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Bugzilla Version and Target Milestone fields
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Versions are snapshot of code that were tested, tagged and released to production.
            </li>
            <li>
                The value of Bugzilla version field is the version number of the production release the bug was reported in.
                Version 1.0.0, for example, contains
                <a href="http://www.ebill.co.il/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=iBill&version=1.0.0">
                    these
                </a>
                bugs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Milestones are "targets" that you plan to get a bug fixed by. 
                The value of Bugzilla milestone field can be something like: next-release, unknown, release-1.0.0.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changing the milestone field of a bug, from unknown to next-release, means that we plan to close it until next release deadline.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Application META-INF
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The value of the <strong>version</strong> entry in META-INF/about.properties should show the correct release version the Jar file is part of.
            </li>
            <li>
                It should be changed from "unspecified" to the specific version number right after release-x.y.z branch is created.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Release 1.0.0 example
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Decide which bugs will be fixed by the release-1.0.0 deadline and change the value of their milestone field to milestone-1.0.0.
            </li>
            <li>
                Resolve and close all the bugs of milestone-1.0.0.
            <li>
                Create <strong>release-1.0.0</strong> branch, based on develop
            </li>
            <li>
                In the newly created release-1.0.0 branch, set the value of META-INF/about.properties version entry to 1.0.0
            </li>
            <li>
                Push release-1.0.0 branch to origin
            </li>
            <li>
                Build, test and fix critical bugs
            </li>
            <li>
                Merge release-1.0.0 with master, and tag it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Merge release-1.0.0 with develop
            </li>
            <li>
                In the develop branch, set the value of META-INF/about.properties version entry to "unspecified".
                Or resolve the merge conflict by accepting the develop branch value.
                Both methods should have the same effect.
