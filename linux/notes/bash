some times dos2unix needs to be executed before

Loop over set of files:
   for f in *.html; do iconv -f WINDOWS-1255 -t UTF-8 $f > /tmp/$f ; done

Read text file line by line:
   exec < $TEMP; while read line; do echo $line ; done
   while read line; do echo $line ; done < myfile.txt

change to current dir
   cd `dirname "$0"`

store full path to file in current dir
   FULL_PATH=`pwd`/FILE_NAME

extract file name and parent folder from path
	

Print all environment variables:
   printenv


Test if file exist:

	if [ -f $1 ];
	then
	   echo "File $1 exists."
	else
	   echo "File $1 does not exist."
	fi

Find and exec:
find . -exec grep foo {} +
